# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 15

Today was a good day. It was nice to hear about what's coming for us in Code 301. I am super excited to start learning about JQuery and API's. I also really enjoyed hearing from Duncan about his JavaScript 401 class. I've definitely decided that that's the track I would like to take.

### Merge Conflicts Exercise
I didn't like this exercise. I could see how it might be helpful, but honestly the biggest headache was trying to figure out which character we were playing... So dang confusing. There must be a better way. That said, I do feel slightly more confident about dealing with merge conflicts on GitHub now though.

### Team Planning
I am happy with the team I have for final projects and I really feel like we are going to work great together. Planning today and getting picking which project idea we wanted to do was a breeze. I am looking forward to working with them and doing our final project together.
