# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 6

Today we learned a ton! We learned about domain models. A domain model is a conceptual model that includes data and behavior. It takes real life problems and solves them using code. We learned about the DOM tree. And we learned how to write HTML into the DOM. You create an HTML element, give that element content, and the append the element to the DOM.

<b>Two helpful times we learned today was:</b><br>
1. Objects are a collection, and arrays are a list.<br>
2. You can't use a loop for objects, but you can use a loop on an array that's within an object.

Today's lab was very challenging but doable. We had to create object literals that represent different store locations and their data. There were a log of steps but I understand everything we did and was able to get it done. I'm excited to see what tomorrow brings.
