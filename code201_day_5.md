# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 5

##### Today in class we learned about images, functions, and git branches.

### Images
We learned about the importance of being aware of copyrights and using images that are available. When working for a company it's usually a good idea to make a budget for images and video.
A good resource for images is gettyimages.com.
Another important topic in tech right now is web accessibility and the use of screen readers.

Also, you need to respect the aspect ratio of images or else they will become distorted.

### Functions
The functions we had to build in lab today was a difficult exercise but I ended up understanding everything I did and can see how using previous functions inside of new functions can be extremely useful and help avoid writing more code than you need to.

### Git Branches
Using git branches was a breeze today. I thankfully had no issues, and over the weekend had no issues in deploying my about_me page. Here is the procedure of using branches that are in my notes.

1. initial commit
2. create new branch and enter new branch (git checkout -b 'branch_name')
3. edit files
4. git add/commit/push TO BRANCH
5. go back to master branch
6. GitHub merge files
7. pull new merge down to the master branch on your laptop
8. then repeat steps 2-7
