# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 7

### Code Example from Yesterday's Lab
Going over the code from yesterday today and watching it being built again was extremely helpful. The repetition is good. I had pretty much the same code he had except for I had my document.getElementById's all at the top of my code and I used my location property to add the name to the DOM. No biggies, just extra's.



Helpful tips:
1. always check if all files are wired to the HTML <br>
2. this. this. this. don't forget the this. <br>
3. think of when to use Math.floor or Math.ceil
