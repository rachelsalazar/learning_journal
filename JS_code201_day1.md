# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 1

My favorite quote for the day was "This is the time to screw up." I'm definitely very hard on myself, so in this class, I'm going to have to try really hard to allow myself to screw up and learn from it.

It was nice to learn exactly what each Code Class (201, 301...) is about. Code 201 has to do with the client side. Where 301 focuses more on the server side, and 401 teaches how to build the entire stack.

We also learned about Unix Commands and Git & Git Hub. Some common commands in Unix include:

ls (list the files in your current directory)
mkdir (makes a new directory)
touch (makes new file)
mv (relocate or rename file/directory)
pwd (prints working directory)

And we learned the importance of naming your files/directories in the correct way. No spaces, no capitals. Example: my_project_file.html (GOOD), My Project File.html (BAD).

Another thing we learned/reviewed was how to make new repositories in GitHub. I already knew quite a bit about the things we went over today, so it was more of a review. So that was great.

We also learned a few keyboard shortcuts for our comuters. SUPER helpful.

Lastly, our coding project for the day was to write JavaScript within and HTML file that has 4 prompts stored in a variable and 4 alert messages that generates output to the user which incorporates their answers to the prompts. It was pretty simple and fun to learn how JavaScript is added or linked to HTML. 

That was my day! PRETTY SUCCESSFUL!
