# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 2

Today I finally have a really firm understanding of the git ACP process. I understood it before but today I was able to use it without really have to think about it. I am happy I am feeling confident about this as I have a feeling we will be moving onto more complicated git processes soon.

It was also great to have the <link> element in HTML explained better.
href - specifies the path to the css file, ie. <link href="style.css">
rel - expresses the relationship between/to the HTML page. "stylesheet" should be used for CSS.
type - tells older browsers what kind of file it is. but this isn't <i>really</i> needed.
so a <link> element should end up looking like this: <link href="file_path.css" rel="stylesheet">

Also, in CSS, we learned more about the "cascading" effect. (The parents, siblings, and inheritance). I found the extremely helpful in understanding a little bit better how CSS rules are laid out.

In lab today we created a guessing game with JavaScript and a portfolio page with HTML/CSS. The JavaScript was the most challenging part but I was able to get through it with a little bit of help. And I had fun using HTML and CSS today.
My one take away from today's lab is that "if else" statements do not have to be within a function. They can stand on their own.
