# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 11

Today we learned a few helpful tips in CSS such as using float to align things like a header image and using the attribute 'last-child' in list items to fix the last item in the list. I also learned that <a> stands for anchor.

### Today's Lab
TODAY WAS HARD! I learned how to put images into the DOM using JS and also how to make that image change. I was also able to calculate how many times a certain image is shown on the screen. I had trouble counting the number of clicks on a certain image and also figuring out how to make an image not appear in the next screen. I am proud of myself for the stuff I was able to do but I'm also super hard on myself when I'm not able to get things done. I'm excited to see the code review for today's lab. Hopefully that will clear a few things up.
